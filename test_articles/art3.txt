A few months after Cory Monteith's passing, Lea Michele is doing her best to move on. 

"I know that Cory would want nothing more than for me to take this situation and use it to help people," she said in the December issue of Elle Magazine (via Gossip Cop). 

“I don’t know if I will. I don’t know how. 

“Now that I’m in this position, you can choose to rise, which is what I’m going to try to do," she continued. 

"It’s very hard, and you have to be very strong to come out of this alive, but I think by doing the best for myself, by showing that you don’t have to lose yourself, maybe someone else will feel some sort of strength or comfort." 

Kate Hudson turned out to be that source for Michele. 

“I called her and said, I don’t know where I’m going to go because my house is swarmed [with reporters.] She was like, ‘Oh, you’re going to stay at my house.’ Like it was nothing,” Michele said. 

“She let my family stay there, and any of my friends. She made sure that in the refrigerator were my favorite juices.” 

“I’ll never really be able to thank her, truly, for what she did for me.” 

Michele also revealed that she and Monteith briefly dated when Glee premiered, but "no one really caught on." 

In 2011, they decided to give it another go.  “We just looked at each other and we were like, ‘You wanna do this?’ We knew,” Michele said.
