==============

# Run

You have to have [maven](http://maven.apache.org) and git. Simply clone:

```
git clone https://github.com/neojski/bullshit-paper
```

Then you can use just maven stuff to install dependencies:

```
mvn package
```

It also runs tests. In case you're changing something tests can be fired with
`mvn test`. (use `-Dtest=bullshit_paper.NameOfTest` to run single test)
